It was warm. We mostly played in the snow but we went up and down that hill a couple of times. He was pretty brave for parts of it, and managed to turn. I would push him up the hill so he didn't have to walk, because the tow rope was broken. At the end we begged them to let us ride up the bunny lift, and they did, but Peter was too scared so I showed him how to slide down on his bottom, and we made it down.
