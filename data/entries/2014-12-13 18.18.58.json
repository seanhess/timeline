We visited Karen and Aaron at their apartment, went to sushi, then went to a game night with some friends Catherine had met at her party. They were a rowdy bunch. After the only mormon couple left, we got to talk about our leaving-the-church stories. We stayed way too long, until 2am! I was super tired. "}
